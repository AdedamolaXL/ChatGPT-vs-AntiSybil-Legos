# ChatGPT-vs-AntiSybil-Legos
An analysis of existing anti sybil legos within the Gitcoin protocol against malicious use of AI algorithims like ChatGPT

## 1. Address Correlation Lego

How it works: The "address correlation Lego" is a pattern-identification Lego that is intended to be used against previously known sybil patterns that will be stored in a readable format (currently using a pandas dataframe). Its purpose is to judge the correlation between the activities of an address and those of sybil addresses using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.

How it can be exploited:
  * Limited detection capabilities: The protocol relies solely on previously known sybil patterns stored in a readable format, which may not capture all possible patterns or new and evolving sybil techniques used by malicious chatbots. Malicious use of chatbots like ChatGPT can potentially exploit this by employing novel or sophisticated sybil techniques that are not yet known or detected by the protocol.
  
  * Lack of scalability: The protocol may rely on a pandas dataframe, which may not be scalable or efficient in handling large amounts of data. This could potentially limit the protocol's ability to process and analyze data in real-time, especially in a high-transaction environment. Malicious chatbots cam potentially exploit this by overwhelming the system with a large number of transactions or activities to evade detection.
 
 * False positives or false negatives: The accuracy of pattern identification using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient may not be 100% accurate. There may be false positives where legitimate addresses are flagged as sybil, or false negatives where malicious addresses are not flagged. Malicious chatbots could potentially exploit this by either evading detection or triggering false positives that result in legitimate addresses being wrongly flagged.
 
 * Lack of real-time detection: The protocol may not have real-time monitoring capabilities, and it may rely on previously known sybil patterns, which may not be updated in real-time. Malicious chatbots could potentially exploit this by using new or updated sybil techniques that are not yet known or detected by the protocol.


## 2. FLAGGED ACTIVITY

How it works: Returns whether address is in close association with addresses flagged as phishing/scam on Etherscan (send or receive event; last 365 days).

How it can be exploited: 
 * Lack of real-time data: The protocol may rely on data from Etherscan, which may not be real-time or up-to-date. Malicious chatbots could potentially exploit this by performing malicious activities that are not yet flagged on Etherscan, or by using addresses that have not yet been associated with phishing/scam events.
 
 * False positives or false negatives: The accuracy of the phishing/scam flagging on Etherscan may not be 100% accurate. There may be false positives where legitimate addresses are flagged as phishing/scam, or false negatives where malicious addresses are not flagged. Malicious chatbots could potentially exploit this by either evading detection or triggering false positives that result in legitimate addresses being wrongly flagged.

 * Lack of comprehensive phishing/scam detection: The protocol may rely solely on Etherscan for phishing/scam detection, which may not capture all possible phishing/scam activities or new and evolving types of scams. Malicious chatbots could potentially exploit this by employing novel or sophisticated phishing/scam techniques that are not yet flagged on Etherscan.
 
 * Limited scope of detection: The protocol may only consider send or receive events within the last 365 days, which may not capture all possible phishing/scam activities that could have occurred beyond that timeframe. Malicious chatbots could potentially exploit this by using addresses that have been involved in phishing/scam activities prior to the last 365 days.


## 3. SCRIPT CALL TO API

How it works: Imitate Bankless' use of "bot-label" for any python, curl, etc. direct-access to Passport API

How it can be exploited: 

 * "Bot-label" manipulation: Malicious chatbots may be able to manipulate the "bot-label" or forge it to gain unauthorized access to the Passport API. This could allow them to perform actions that are not allowed or intended, leading to potential misuse or abuse of the system.
 
 * Lack of comprehensive bot detection mechanisms: The "bot-label" approach may not be foolproof in accurately identifying and detecting malicious chatbots. Sophisticated chatbots may be able to circumvent or bypass the "bot-label" detection, allowing them to gain unauthorized access.
 
 * Lack of multifactor authentication: The reliance solely on the "bot-label" without additional authentication mechanisms, such as multifactor authentication or token-based authentication, could increase the vulnerability of the protocol to malicious chatbots.
 
 * Limited security measures: If the protocol does not have robust security measures in place to monitor and detect suspicious or malicious activities, it may be more susceptible to attacks from malicious chatbots.
 

## 4. ON-TREND/OFF-TREND

How it works: Determines whether user donation array is within-range for statistical averages of the community

How it can be exploited: 

 *  Manipulation of donation array: Malicious chatbots could potentially manipulate the donation array to fall within the statistical averages of the community, even if the donations are not genuine or do not reflect the true intent of the user. This could lead to inaccurate results and manipulation of the protocol.

 * Automated donations: Malicious chatbots could make automated donations to manipulate the donation array and artificially influence the statistical averages of the community. This could lead to unfair results and manipulation of the protocol.
 
 * False positives/negatives: The protocol may generate false positives or false negatives in determining whether the user's donation array falls within the statistical averages of the community. Malicious chatbots could potentially exploit these false results to gain an unfair advantage or to bypass detection.

 * Lack of comprehensive data validation: The protocol may not have robust mechanisms in place to validate the authenticity and accuracy of the donation array data provided by users, which could be exploited by malicious chatbots to manipulate the results.


## 5. UPALA

How it works: Upala is a decentralized digital identity. The protocol generates human uniqueness score for users. The score is measured in dollars. Each account score is determined by market. Incentives ensure that the score equals the costs of forging the account. The score directly reflects how valuable that identity is to the user and creates an entirely new way to measure reputability in the virtual and real world.

How it can be exploited: 

 * Fake identity creation: Malicious chatbots could potentially create fake identities on the Upala protocol, thereby undermining the integrity of the social identity verification process.

 * Manipulation of social identity data: Malicious chatbots could manipulate social identity data or forge proof of identity, leading to inaccurate or fraudulent verification results.

 * Collusion with real users: Malicious chatbots could collude with real users to fraudulently verify fake identities, leading to unfair distribution of trust scores and reputation within the Upala protocol.

 * Sybil attacks: Malicious chatbots could create multiple fake identities and gain undue influence in the social identity verification process, leading to manipulation of trust scores and reputation.


## 6. POAP - Proof Of Attendance Protocol

How it works: The Proof of Attendance Protocol turns events or hackathons into collectibles. Using blockchain technology, POAP tokenizes your proof of participation, so they can be used as DIDs (decentralized Identifiers).

How it can be exploited: 

 * Fake event submissions: Malicious chatbots could potentially create fake events or hackathons and generate fake proof of attendance to collect POAP tokens, thereby undermining the integrity of the protocol.

 * Sybil attacks: Malicious chatbots could create multiple fake identities and participate in events or hackathons, thereby gaining multiple POAP tokens and manipulating the rewards or incentives associated with the protocol.

 * Manipulation of attendance data: Malicious chatbots could manipulate attendance data or forge proof of attendance to earn POAP tokens without actually participating in the events or hackathons, leading to inaccurate or fraudulent token distribution.

 * Collusion with real users: Malicious chatbots could collude with real users to fraudulently earn POAP tokens by providing fake proof of attendance or manipulating event data, leading to unfair distribution of tokens.


## 7. UBI - Universal Basic Income

How it works: Universal basic income (UBI) aims to address economic inequality and provide security through streamed cash to every human on Earth. It is built on top of Ethereum and the Proof of Humanity protocol. Every human that gets verified by submitting a video of themseleves.

How it can be exploited: 

 * One possible vulnerability is the possibility of a chatbot being able to mimic a human in the video verification process. With advances in AI and deepfakes, it may become increasingly difficult to distinguish between a real human and a bot posing as a human in a video submission. This could potentially allow for bots to fraudulently receive UBI.

 * Another vulnerability could be the potential for a chatbot to collude with a large number of real humans in order to increase its chances of receiving UBI. This could be done by creating a network of bots that interact with and influence real human behavior in order to support the bot's eligibility for UBI.


## 8. Proof of Humanity

How it works: Humans who wish to be included in the registry submit information about themselves serving for verification. Then you can vouch for others and challenge suspicious users just like Kleros.

How it can be exploited: 

 * Chatbots could potentially attempt to bypass the protocol by using pre-recorded videos or deepfake technology to create fake video submissions that appear to be from genuine users. This could pose a potential vulnerability to the protocol if not properly addressed.
 Considering the current limitations of chatbots and the video submission requirement of Proof of Humanity, the vulnerability of the protocol to malicious chatbots is relatively low. 
 
 
 ## 9. IDENA - PROOF OF PERSON BLOCKCHAIN
 
 How it works: The Idena blockchain is driven by Proof-of-Person consensus with every node linked to a cryptoidentity, one person with equal voting power. It suggests a novel way to formalize people on the Internet: Idena proves the humanness and uniqueness of its participants without collecting personally identifiable information by running a Turing test at the same time globally.
 
 How it can be exploited:
 
  * Chatbots, being automated conversational agents, lack human characteristics and are not capable of passing traditional Turing tests that require human-like responses. Therefore, it's unlikely that chatbots would be able to bypass the Proof-of-Person consensus in Idena.


## 10. BrightID

How it works: BrightID is building an identity lego that allows users to prove to applications that they only exist once in any given system. It's one of the legos used in Gitcoin Passport. You can get 50% bonus matching for all your Gitcoin grants by joining BrightID and connecting it to your Gitcoin Passport. 

How it can be exploited:


## 11. LEVENSTEIN DISTANCE

How it works: Every user has a username - when they sign up to Gitcoin grants the similarity of their name can be compared against all other usernames to generate a likelihood of the username being auto-generated - evidence of a Sybil account. This Lego will be deprecated in the grants protocol because usernames will no longer be available - only Ethereum addresses, wallet IDs and grant/round nonce.

How it can be exploited: 

 * Sensitivity to username similarity: The protocol appears to rely on username similarity as a sole indicator of potential Sybil accounts. However, usernames can sometimes be similar among legitimate users due to various reasons, such as common names or naming conventions. This could potentially result in false positives or false negatives, as legitimate users with similar usernames may be flagged as potential Sybil accounts or actual Sybil accounts may go undetected if they use usernames that are not similar.

 * Lack of additional validation factors: The protocol does not seem to consider other validation factors beyond username similarity. Malicious actors could potentially use sophisticated techniques to create usernames that appear legitimate or avoid detection by using random or unrelated usernames.

 * Lack of contextual awareness: The protocol does not appear to consider other contextual factors, such as user behavior, transaction history, or social network analysis, which could provide additional insights into the legitimacy of an account. This could result in potential vulnerabilities as malicious actors could potentially mimic legitimate user behavior and evade detection.

 * Lack of dynamic updates: If the protocol does not have the capability to dynamically update the similarity thresholds or adapt to changing attack patterns, it may become obsolete over time, allowing malicious actors to evade detection.

 * Privacy concerns: Comparing username similarity could raise privacy concerns as it may involve collecting and analyzing user data, potentially leading to potential privacy violations if not handled properly.


## 12. ONCHAIN HISTORY

How it works: This Lego returns a Yes or No value if a user engaged in certain web3 activities in a specific timeframe.

How it can be exploited:

 * Lack of context-awareness: The protocol appears to rely solely on checking if a user has engaged in certain web3 activities within specific timeframes without considering other contextual factors. This could potentially result in false positives or false negatives, as malicious chatbots could potentially mimic legitimate user behavior within the specified timeframes or evade detection by not engaging in the expected activities.

 * Lack of behavioral analysis: The protocol does not seem to consider other potential behavioral analysis techniques beyond checking specific web3 activities within timeframes. Malicious chatbots could potentially use sophisticated techniques to hide their activities or mimic legitimate user behavior, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

 * Lack of multi-factor authentication: The protocol does not appear to implement multi-factor authentication beyond checking specific web3 activities within timeframes. Malicious chatbots could potentially find ways to bypass or manipulate this single-factor authentication, leading to potential vulnerabilities.

 * Lack of dynamic updates: If the protocol does not have the capability to dynamically update the specific web3 activities or timeframes based on changing threats or attack patterns, it may become obsolete over time, allowing malicious chatbots to evade detection.

 * Overreliance on timeframes: The protocol's reliance on specific timeframes may not be effective in detecting sophisticated malicious chatbots that are designed to operate over extended periods of time or evade detection by varying their activity patterns.


## 13. MONEY MIXERS

How it works: Returns a Boolean if a user has interacted with known money-mixers.

How it can be exploited: 

 * Reliance on known money-mixers: The protocol appears to rely on a predefined list of known money-mixers to determine if a user has interacted with them. However, malicious chatbots or other types of attackers can potentially use new or previously unknown money-mixers that are not on the list, thus evading detection.

 * Lack of real-time updates: If the list of known money-mixers is not updated in real-time, the protocol may miss new or emerging money-mixers that are not on the list. Attackers can potentially take advantage of this time lag and use new or unknown money-mixers to evade detection.

 * False positives/negatives: Depending on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the list of known money-mixers, the protocol may generate false positives or false negatives. False positives may result in legitimate users being flagged as potential malicious actors, while false negatives may result in malicious chatbots evading detection.

 * Lack of behavioral analysis: The protocol appears to rely solely on checking if a user has interacted with known money-mixers without considering other potential behavioral analysis techniques. Malicious chatbots could potentially use sophisticated techniques to hide their interactions with money-mixers or use alternative methods to obfuscate their transactions, thus evading detection.

 * Lack of multi-factor authentication: The protocol does not seem to consider other potential factors or implement multi-factor authentication beyond checking interactions with known money-mixers. Malicious chatbots could potentially find ways to bypass or manipulate this single-factor authentication, leading to potential vulnerabilities.


## 14. HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING

How it works: Returns boolean wallet activity timestamps over # of transactions

How it can be exploited: 

 * Over-reliance on a single indicator: The protocol appears to rely solely on the relationship between wallet activity timestamps and the number of transactions, specifically identifying high frequency trading as an indicator of bot-control or automatic wallet-vetting scripts. However, high frequency trading could also be a legitimate activity for human traders or other types of automated trading systems, leading to potential false positives or false negatives.

 * Lack of contextual analysis: The protocol does not seem to consider other contextual factors that could affect wallet activity timestamps, such as market conditions, trading strategies, or other legitimate reasons for high frequency trading. Malicious chatbots could potentially mimic legitimate trading behavior to evade detection, thus making the protocol vulnerable to false results.

 * Potential for false positives/negatives: Depending on the specific threshold or criteria used to identify high frequency trading as an indicator of bot-control or automatic wallet-vetting scripts, the protocol may generate false positives or false negatives. For example, some legitimate trading strategies may involve high frequency trading that does not involve malicious activities, leading to false positives. On the other hand, some malicious chatbots may engage in low frequency trading to avoid detection, leading to false negatives.

 * Lack of behavioral analysis: The protocol does not seem to consider other potential behavioral analysis techniques beyond wallet activity timestamps, such as transaction patterns, transaction destinations, or other contextual factors. This may make the protocol vulnerable to malicious chatbots that can mimic legitimate transaction behavior or other activities, thus evading detection.

 * Lack of multi-factor authentication: The protocol appears to rely solely on wallet activity timestamps and the number of transactions as indicators, without considering other potential factors or implementing multi-factor authentication. Malicious chatbots could potentially find ways to circumvent or manipulate wallet activity timestamps, leading to inaccurate results and potential vulnerabilities.


## 15. SOCIAL PRESENCE

How it works: Returns Boolean if a project is within 1 standard deviation from the dynamic mean.

How it can be exploited: 

 * Lack of multi-factor authentication: The protocol appears to rely solely on the relationship between the number of unique donations received and the number of Twitter followers, without considering other potential factors that could affect this relationship. Malicious chatbots could potentially manipulate either the number of unique donations or the number of Twitter followers to create a false perception of legitimacy, thus evading detection.

 * Vulnerability to follower manipulation: The protocol relies on the number of Twitter followers as a key factor, which could be easily manipulated by malicious chatbots through purchasing fake followers or artificially inflating follower counts. This could lead to false results and inaccurate evaluations of legitimacy.

 * Sensitivity to standard deviation threshold: The protocol uses a standard deviation threshold to determine if a project is within an acceptable range, which may not be robust enough to accurately identify malicious chatbot activity. A small change in the standard deviation threshold could potentially lead to false positives or false negatives, resulting in inaccurate evaluations of legitimacy.

 * Reliance on a single measure: The protocol appears to rely solely on the relationship between the number of unique donations and the number of Twitter followers, which may not be comprehensive or robust enough to detect all types of malicious chatbot activity. Malicious chatbots may find ways to circumvent this measure, such as by manipulating donation amounts or follower counts, thus potentially evading detection.

 * Lack of behavioral analysis: The protocol does not seem to consider other potential behavioral analysis techniques, such as transaction patterns, transaction destinations, or other social media activity, beyond the relationship between unique donations and Twitter followers. This may make the protocol vulnerable to malicious chatbots that can mimic legitimate transaction behavior or social media activity, thus evading detection.


## 16. FARMER BOOLEAN

How it works:  uses on-chain data to determine whether a user has >X ERC-20 tokens and an average transaction value <Y ETH)

How it can be exploited: 

 * Susceptibility to token manipulation: The protocol relies on on-chain data to determine if a user has a certain number of ERC-20 tokens and an average transaction value below a certain threshold. Malicious chatbots may manipulate token balances or transaction values to meet the criteria and evade detection. For example, they could artificially inflate token balances or conduct transactions with manipulated values to appear as legitimate users.

 * Lack of comprehensive detection techniques: The protocol seems to rely solely on the criteria of ERC-20 token balance and average transaction value, without considering other potential techniques that malicious chatbots may use, such as IP address manipulation, network behavior, transaction timing, or transaction patterns. This may make the protocol vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks that do not rely solely on meeting the criteria of ERC-20 token balance and transaction value.

 * Potential false positives/negatives: The protocol may generate false positives or false negatives due to the reliance on specific thresholds for ERC-20 token balance and average transaction value. Legitimate users who do not meet these criteria but are not malicious chatbots may be flagged as false positives, while malicious chatbots that can manipulate token balances or transaction values may evade detection as false negatives.

 * Lack of behavioral analysis: The protocol does not seem to consider behavioral analysis of the user beyond token balances and transaction values, such as transaction patterns, transaction destinations, or other on-chain activities. This may make the protocol vulnerable to malicious chatbots that can mimic legitimate transaction behavior or carry out attacks using subtle transaction patterns or destinations.

 * Reliance on a single measure: The protocol appears to rely solely on the criteria of ERC-20 token balance and average transaction value, which may not be comprehensive or robust enough to detect all types of malicious chatbot activity. Malicious chatbots may find ways to circumvent this measure, such as by manipulating token balances or transaction values, thus potentially evading detection.


## 17. FUNDING WALLET IS UNIQUE

How it works: Returns Boolean for uniqueness of funding wallet.

How it can be exploited: 

 * Lack of multi-factor authentication: The protocol appears to rely solely on checking if a funding wallet is unique, which may not be a robust security measure. Malicious chatbots may be able to create multiple funding wallets or spoof unique wallet addresses, thus potentially evading detection.

 * Lack of comprehensive detection techniques: The protocol seems to rely solely on checking the uniqueness of the funding wallet, without considering other potential techniques that malicious chatbots may use, such as IP address manipulation, transaction amounts, network behavior, or transaction timing. This may make the protocol vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks that do not rely solely on wallet address uniqueness.

 * Lack of real-time monitoring: The protocol may not have real-time monitoring capabilities, and the uniqueness of the funding wallet may be checked based on historical data, which may not be updated in real-time. This could potentially allow malicious chatbots to create or manipulate funding wallets in real-time and evade detection based on this measure.

 * Lack of behavioral analysis: The protocol does not seem to consider behavioral analysis of the funding wallet, such as transaction patterns or transaction destinations, which could potentially be used to detect suspicious or malicious activity. This may make the protocol vulnerable to malicious chatbots that can mimic legitimate transaction behavior or carry out attacks using subtle transaction patterns.

 * Reliance on a single measure: The protocol appears to rely solely on the uniqueness of the funding wallet, which may not be a comprehensive or robust security measure. Malicious chatbots may find ways to circumvent this measure, such as by creating unique wallet addresses or spoofing wallet addresses, thus potentially evading detection.


## 18. SLAYSYBIL 

How it works: Tracking bulk transfers and donations to detect sybils with observing sequential behaviour pattern and asset-transfer graph. 

How it can be exploited: 

 * Reliance on sequential behavior patterns: The protocol relies on detecting sequential behavior patterns, which may be vulnerable to manipulation by sophisticated malicious chatbots. Advanced chatbots may be able to mimic legitimate sequential behavior patterns to evade detection, thus potentially bypassing this measure.

 * Reliance on asset-transfer graph: The protocol also relies on observing the asset-transfer graph to detect Sybil attacks. However, this approach may be susceptible to manipulation by malicious chatbots that can create fake asset-transfer graph patterns or mimic legitimate asset-transfer behavior, thus potentially evading detection.

 * Lack of multi-factor authentication: The protocol may rely solely on sequential behavior patterns and asset-transfer graph observation, without considering other factors or additional layers of authentication. This may make it vulnerable to advanced malicious chatbots that can bypass or manipulate these measures and carry out their attacks.

 * Lack of real-time detection: The protocol may not have real-time monitoring capabilities, and the sequential behavior patterns and asset-transfer graph may be analyzed based on historical data, which may not be updated in real-time. This could potentially allow malicious chatbots to carry out attacks in real-time and evade detection based on these measures.

 * Lack of comprehensive detection techniques: The protocol seems to rely solely on sequential behavior patterns and asset-transfer graph observation, without considering other potential techniques that malicious chatbots may use, such as transaction amounts, network behavior, or transaction timing. This may make the protocol vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks that do not rely solely on sequential behavior patterns or asset-transfer graph observations.


## 19. ONCHAIN FOOTPRINT LEGO

How it works: The TDD (Transaction Date Mean Difference) metric is utilized by this Lego, and it is computed by subtracting each transaction date from the following one to obtain the difference, then dividing by the total number of transactions (i.e., the mean difference or average difference).

How it can be exploited: 

 * Reliance on transaction date mean difference: The protocol relies on the "transaction date mean difference" as a security measure. However, this approach may have some potential vulnerabilities. For instance, a sophisticated malicious chatbot could potentially manipulate the transaction dates to create a pattern that mimics legitimate transaction behavior, thus evading detection based on this measure.

 * Lack of multi-factor authentication: The protocol seems to rely solely on the "transaction date mean difference" as a security measure, without considering other factors or additional layers of authentication. This may make it vulnerable to advanced malicious chatbots that can bypass or manipulate the "transaction date mean difference" measure and carry out their attacks.

 * Lack of real-time detection: The protocol may not have real-time monitoring capabilities, and the "transaction date mean difference" may be calculated based on historical transaction data, which may not be updated in real-time. This could potentially allow malicious chatbots to carry out attacks in real-time and evade detection based on this measure.

 * Lack of comprehensive detection techniques: The protocol seems to rely solely on the "transaction date mean difference" to counter Sybil attacks, without considering other potential techniques that malicious chatbots may use, such as transaction patterns, transaction amounts, or network behavior. This may make the protocol vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks that do not rely solely on transaction count-based security measures.
